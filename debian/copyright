Comment: It further comes with this note by Larry Finger:
 NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use DRAWxtl
 as a helper program - this is merely considered normal use
 of the program, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
 Also note that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software
 Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (the DRAWxtl
 program) is copyrighted by me, Martin Kroeker, and Brian Toby.
 .
 Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this program
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.

Comment: The license chosen is the GNU Library General Public License 2 with
 the following exceptions (see http://www.fltk.org/COPYING.php):
 .
 The FLTK library and included programs are provided under the terms of the
 GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) with the following exceptions:
 .
 1. Modifications to the FLTK configure script, config header file, and
    makefiles by themselves to support a specific platform do not constitute
    a modified or derivative work.
 .
    The authors do request that such modifications be contributed to the
    FLTK project - send all contributions to "fltk-bugs@fltk.org".
 .
 2. Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do not constitute a
    derivative work.
 .
 3. Static linking of applications and widgets to the FLTK library does not
    constitute a derivative work and does not require the author to provide
    source code for the application or widget, use the shared FLTK
    libraries, or link their applications or widgets against a
    user-supplied version of FLTK.
 .
    If you link the application or widget to a modified version of FLTK,
    then the changes to FLTK must be provided under the terms of the LGPL
    in sections 1, 2, and 4.
 .
 4. You do not have to provide a copy of the FLTK license with programs
    that are linked to the FLTK library, nor do you have to identify the
    FLTK license in your program or documentation as required by section 6
    of the LGPL.
 .
    However, programs must still identify their use of FLTK. The following
    example statement can be included in user documentation to satisfy this
    requirement:
 .
    [program/widget] is based in part on the work of the FLTK project
    (http://www.fltk.org).
